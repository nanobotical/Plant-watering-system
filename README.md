# Plant-watering-system
Plant watering system made with FreeRTOS

This project is an automated plant-waterer (and caretaker). It constantly measures (and modifies, as needed) the amount of light, the moisture of the soil (by means of measuring the humidity of the air immediately above the soil), as well as the ambient temperature, in order to maintain the optimal environment for a given plant determined by the user. Additionally, it is maximally customizable, offering not only presets that are tailored to particular types of plants, such as (possibly) succulents/cacti, small flowering/fruiting plants, and culinary herbs, but also precise customizations of environmental parameters.
